#Assignment 3 - CSCI 4100 (APSU)
##About
This project is an assignment for CSCI 4100 (Operating System Architecture) course at APSU. Being this is an educational project for a grade, collaboration isn't exactly the goal here. But if you feel that you can benefit from perusing my code, go for it! 

##What it Does
This program is a basic shell written in C that executes system commands.

##Usage
Compile with `gcc -o crash davisAssign3.c`
Execute with `./crash`
Enter `exit` to quit the shell.

##Academic Honesty
Please, just keep in mind that academic dishonesty is probably (definitely) not tolerated by your educational institution, so come up with your own solutions. Besides, I sincerely doubt that your assignment has the same requirements as mine, so you will probably look like an idiot if you try to turn this in.

##Credits
No outside assistance on this.

##Questions/Comments/Concerns
If you have any questions regarding this project, send me a message and I'd be more than happy to explain my code.
